# Aesthetic_hbs
An aesthetic template that you could modify with some info

## Â¿How was did build it?
This website was developed because I wanted to apply my recently acquired knowledge of Node.js and importants packages like dotenv.js, express.js and handlebars.js
 also I use the architecture pattern MVC (Model View Controller), this is just a basic template.
 
## Goals completed
* Use MVC
* Definate the routing with Node.js and express.js
* Separate the views in the principal view and the others partials with handlebars.js

## Observation
Like you can see, "node_modules/" is in the .gitignore file, so for running the app, you need the corresponding packages, just execute the next command (you need to have node and npm in your computer obviusly)

```
npm init
```

## Possibly isues
If you have a problem with the port 8080, just change it in the .env file

## Technologies and tools
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Handlebars.js
* Dotenv.js
* ScrollReveal.js
* JavaScript
